=======


* LuaGRAPH
  --------
  
  LuaGRAPH is a binding to the graphviz library.

  LuaGRAPH requires the graphviz library version 2.26 or later, which
  can be downloaded from 
	
	http://www.graphviz.org/


  You must have Lua version 5.1. Lua can be downloaded 
  from its home page:
	  http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/lua/

  If you use LuaGRAPH with Lua 5.0 you should have the compat-5.1 package properly
  installed on your system. Note, Lua 5.0 is no longer officially supported by
  LuaGRAPH.
  If you use LuaGRAPH with Lua 5.1 you should set the compiler switch COMPAT_H in
  your makefile.


* Documentation
  -------------

  Documentation of LuaGRAPH comes with the LuaGRAPH distribution. I recommend also to
  read the graphviz documentation, which can be found here:

	http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php
	

* Legal matters
  -------------

  See the license agreement in the file LICENSE.
  For the graphviz license see the file COPYING.

* Download
  --------
  LuaGRAPH can be downloaded from LuaForge at 
	
	http://luaforge.net

* Installation
  ------------

  In order to build LuaGRAPH on a Linux, Unix or Cygwin/Mingw based
  POSIX like system:

  1. Make sure you have Lua 5.1. LuaGRAPH may still work with Lua 5.0.
     However, Lua 5.0 is no longer officially supported.
     The file test.lua in the test subdirectory uses lualogging which 
     can be downloaded from LuaForge at http://luaforge.net or via
     LuaRocks at http://www.luarocks.org.

  2. With graphviz version 2.12 you might have to use the `ltdl' library 
     that comes with graphviz in order to have the rendering plugins to 
     work properly. Version 2.26 is currently the last graphviz version
     that is supported.

  3. LuaGRAPH comes with a makefile and a simple config file to adopt
     the make process to your target system.

  4. Adopt build configuration to your platform by editing the file
     config according to you needs.

  5. Compile the package

     Type 
	make

     If make succeeds you get:

     * a Lua extension library "graph.so.x.0" in the src sub-directory.
     * a copy "core.so" of the same Lua extension library in ./graph

  6. Type "make install" as user root in order to install all relevant
     files in standard places. The directory /usr/local is the default
     install prefix.
